I am a Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience in developing NLP and deep learning solutions. I am currently working at Zee5 in Mumbai, India. I have worked on several ML/DL projects like Text classification, Sentiment Analysis, Entity extraction, word and phrase representation, video editing tools and recommendation systems. Apart from my professional work, I also participate in Machine learning and Deep learning competetions on Kaggle and other platforms.
